## Description

This repository was created to complete the project for Programming and Scripting module. 
The aim of the project is to research and analyse the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set.

## Repository contenet

There are two main files in this repository:
1. **IrisDataSetAnalysis.ipynb** provides an overview of Fisher’s Iris data set, investigates the data and attributes of the dataframe and provides visual analysis of the data in a user friendly Jupyter notebook format.
2. **analysis.py** contains python code which has been used to perform the analysis of the data. The program performs the following:
    1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
    3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
    4. Performs additional analysis of the data
3. data folder contains iris.data (original data set) and text files (which are saved when running the code as explained above)
4. Images folder contains images used in jupyter notebook and histograms (which are saved when running the code as explained above)
